Mostly a test project to practice with Github pages and tool to make fonts visual from a set of fonts from subfolders using scalable TypeScript code.

Features:
 - Dynamically load fonts from folder (.ttf/.otf/.woff/.woff2)
 - Display fonts directly from sample text
 - Filter for licensed vs unlicensed fonts (Disclaimer to be added with proper authors attached)
 - Host can add filters without needing to rewrite any code (Filters are based on subfolder names from assets/fonts/)
 - Added canvas option to port text to png for easy simplified usage

To do:
- Add disclaimers & author credits with links if available
- Add way to link up personal folder for session usage if possible
- Subjugate to personal portfolio when it is actually made
- Restyle font cards for nicer look
